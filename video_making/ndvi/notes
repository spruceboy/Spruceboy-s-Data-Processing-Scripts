this directory contains some very rough scripts used to generate movies from colorized ndvi data.  Its not indended to be usefuly to anyone but me, so YMMV, very much so.

After the frames are generated, turn them into a movie like this:
mencoder mf://*.jpg -mf w=1280:h=1024:fps=10:type=jpg -ovc x264 -x264encopts subq=6:partitions=all:8x8dct:me=umh:frameref=5:bframes=3:weight_b -o output.avi

encodes to a h264 standard, which appears to work pretty well on windows based machines and is reasonably small.
